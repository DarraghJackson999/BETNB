# Market Lifecycle

Each BETNB market progresses through clearly defined states. Understanding these states helps operations teams coordinate listings, liquidity, and settlement tasks.

  - Proposed trading halt time and settlement buffer
  - Liquidity seed (min 5,000 USDC or equivalent)
- **Outputs:** Market ID reserved, slug created, and due diligence ticket opened in Jira.

## 2. Vetting

- KYC / compliance screening on proposers

## 6. Resolution
